ðŸ“Œ Telco Customer Churn Prediction
ðŸ“– Problem

Telecom companies face customer churn (customers leaving the service). The goal is to predict which customers are likely to churn, so the business can take action to retain them.

ðŸ›  Solution

Used the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle (Blastchar version).

Performed data cleaning & preprocessing:

Removed unnecessary columns (customerID)

Converted TotalCharges to numeric

Encoded categorical features (Label Encoding + One-Hot Encoding)

Scaled numeric features

Built and compared machine learning models:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Classifier (final model)

Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix.

Identified top features influencing churn (e.g., Contract type, Monthly Charges, Tenure, Internet Service).

Saved the trained model using joblib for deployment.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn

joblib

ðŸ“Š Impact

Built a model that predicts customer churn with good accuracy.

Helped identify important factors behind churn (contract type, tenure, monthly charges).

Business can now target at-risk customers with retention offers, reducing revenue loss.
